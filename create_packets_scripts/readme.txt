Main file to run is create_data.py
In order to run it, specific folders need to be made (no file checking in script).
The name of the folders is in the script - Data_****
Inside the folders, a file named 'index' need to be made with the index you want to start with. I.e. - to start with index 0 you needd to make "echo 0 > ./Data_****/index"
The scripts is currently heavily commented out, so not to make redundant packets.

NOTE - All packet creations depend on the relevant program/workspace exisiting on the platform you are using.
Exploit workspaces are available through the relevant repositories stored in the drive excel.
RDP programs can be install using apt-gets
